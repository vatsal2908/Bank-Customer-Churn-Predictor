# Bank-Customer-Churn-Predictor
This repository contains a Bank Churn Predictor created using various machine learning algorithms and a deep learning sequential model. It's incorporated into a user-friendly Flask web application, aiming to predict customer churn in banking services.

# Key Features

1. Multiple Machine Learning Models : 
Implementing a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to enhance the accuracy of churn predictions.

2. Deep Learning Sequential Model : 
Incorporating a deep learning sequential model to capture intricate patterns and nuances in customer behavior for improved churn forecasting.

3. Flask Web Application :
Providing an intuitive and interactive interface, the predictor is seamlessly integrated into a Flask web application for easy accessibility.

# Tecnologies used

1. Machine learning : Implemented various machine learning algorithm like Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest with inbuilt python libraries.
2. Deep Learning : Implemented Python's Sequential Model for deep learning integration.
3. Web Framework : Used flask to create a good user interface.

# How It Works

1. Dataset : 
Utilizing a comprehensive dataset containing customer information, account details, and historical transaction data. Dataset is taken from kaggle.

2. Data Preprocessing : 
Meticulously cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure optimal performance during model training.

3. Model Training : 
Various model will be trained for various algorithms and then best model will be choosen.

4. Input Features :
User input relevent customer data for churn prediction using web interface.

5. Churn Prediction : 
Executing the prediction script within the Flask web application to analyze current customer data and forecast potential churn, providing actionable insights for retention strategies.

# Setup and Usage

Requirements : Python with all required libraries like tensorflow, sklearn, seaborn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib with all required dependencies.

Execution : Run the flask app to open the churn predictor

User Interaction : User give input customer data to interface.

Result : User can get the predicted output via web interface.
